Text files

cat - used to create file and display the text of files.

cat /etc/hosts

	Use the spacebar to show the next screen
	Use enter key to show the next line of the file content
	Use letter q to terminte the command
	
less /etc/passwd

	spacebar - next window
	letter b - previous window
	enter key - next line
	letter y - previous line

tail /etc/hosts
-view last lines of the file

When used with -n option, they specify how many lines to display 
	head -n 3 /etc/hosts
	
	tail -n 3 /etc/hosts
	
Command Line Pipes
The pipe | - send output of one command into the input of another command

ls -l /etc | head

There is also an option of using multiple pipes 
cat /etc/passwd | head -n 3 | tail -n 2 | sort

Input/Output Redirection
STDOUT - Standard output 
-Displays output of a command on the screen

Examples
echo "Line 1"

Using >, the standard output of a command will be redirected to a file.
	echo "Line 1" > example.txt
	
cat example.txt

> will overwrite the content of an existing file.
>> will append the new content to the current of a file
Both the above create a file if the line doesn't exist

STDERR - Standard error
-any wrong command writes on the screen.
In cases of noting down the error on a file, it will be redirected using 2> or 2>>

Example:
ls blah
ls: cannot access blah: No such file or directory

To print the above error in a file, we can redirect in a file.
	ls blah 2> ls.error.txt

double pipe (logical OR) ||, the second command executes if the first one fails
cal || date
